# Phillies
Hello, welcome to my responce to the Phillies Questionaire for perspective employees. You will find the sorce code used to create my application in here.

# Install 
To get access to the application click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gc9vGKskQiJC9X-tEv9exhSnSDCIN-r_/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> (right click and open in new tab) and dowload QualOffer.exe the file is too large to put directly in the repo. 

# How to Use
To run my program simply right click the exe file and select run, you might run into issues with your firewall so I recomeend running the program as administrator. 

# Expected Results
After running the program, it will take a moment (2-3 minutes) to pull, clean, and analyze the data. You can expect to get a pop up window that shows a grpah and the calculated value of the qualifying offer. The program will also create a copy of that image as a png located in the same place as the application in your sytems directory. 

# What I Did 
I completed this project in Jupyter Notebook using the Pandas and Matplot libraries. I read the data from the HTML page, converted it into a data type that I could manipulate and then cleaned the data frame of any immproperly formatted data. I then sorted the dataframe by salary, took the average of the top 150 and created a visual to display that information. After the application was functional in Jupyter Notebook I converted it into a .py file then used pyinstaller to create an executable application that once again you can find at the link above.

# Responce
Also present in this repository is my responce to the Python question about determining is a string is or is not a palindrome. 

# Regards
To whomever is reading this, thank you for you time, interest, and consideration of my work. Hope you have a great rest of your day!
